/* Rules For Variables Name

=> the first character must be a letter or an underscore (_) or an dollar ($) . you cant use a number as the first character  i.e 1myage is not valid 
nd console will give error.
=> the rest of the variable name can include any letter, any number, or the underscore. Cant use any other characters, including spaces.
=> variable names are case sensitive.
=> We cant use special characters like % in variable name as console will give error to this.
